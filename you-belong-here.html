          I still remember my first day of clinicals – standing frozen in the corner of a patient's room, staring at all the scary machines and tubes, feeling like an absolute fraud while everyone around me seemed to know exactly what they were doing. I wondered what I'd possibly gotten myself into.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          Then there was my first day in the PICU rotation. I experienced the oh-so painful sting of being laughed at by staff nurses when I didn't know an answer. I even overheard them talking about me and how student nurses are "the worst." That day ended with me sobbing on my professor's shoulder in the hospital chapel. Not my proudest moment, but spoiler alert: I survived, and now I'm here to tell you that you absolutely will, too!

          Nursing IS serious business. We hold lives in our hands. But here's what I wish my nursing instructors (and preceptors) had told me to help build confidence:

              <span class="list-item-title">Making mistakes is part of learning.</span> It's not a threat to your ability as a nurse. The difference between good and great nurses isn't based on the number of mistakes but on how you recover and learn from them. Those who view errors as opportunities for growth become the strongest nurses in the end.

              <span class="list-item-title">You don't need to know everything.</span> Seriously. Experienced nurses still Google things, ask questions, and phone a friend. The skill is knowing WHEN you need help, not never needing it.

          I started in the ICU with zero nursing experience beyond what I had learned in clinicals. Most of my peers had some sort of experience working with patients (CNA, patient tech, etc.), but I had never even worked at a hospital before. I felt miles behind my peers from the start. I thought every nurse I interacted with could tell.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          But that did not stop me from succeeding like I thought it would.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          And I succeeded not because I was perfect—far from it—but because I cared enough to keep showing up and learning.

          That's all you need to do right now. Show up. Try. Learn. Repeat.
